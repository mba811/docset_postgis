        slower than they are on geometry.  If
		 you use geography -- you don't need to learn much about planar coordinate systems. Geography is generally best
		 if all you care about is measuring distances and lengths and you have data from all over the world.
		 Geometry data type is an older data type that has many more functions supporting it, enjoys greater support from third party tools,
		 and operations on it are generally faster -- sometimes as much as 10 fold faster for larger geometries.
		 Geometry is best if you are pretty comfortable with spatial reference systems or you are dealing with localized data
		  where all your data fits in a single <a class="link" href="using_postgis_dbmanagement.html#spatial_ref_sys" title="4.3.1. The SPATIAL_REF_SYS Table and Spatial Reference Systems">spatial reference system (SRID)</a>, or you need to do a lot of spatial processing.
		  Note: It is fairly easy to do one-off conversions between the two types to gain the benefits of each.

        you can make use of; and, are you doing expensive calculations on a
        large number of geometries.</p><p>In general, you will want to use the "intersects operator"
        (&amp;&amp;) which tests whether the bounding boxes of features

        ST_Intersects(), ST_Contains() and ST_Within(), among others, to
        narrow down the results of your search. Most spatial queries include
        both an indexed test and a spatial function test. The index test
